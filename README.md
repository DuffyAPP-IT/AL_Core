# AL_Core
AL_Core provides the foundations for my commercial software AgentLIVE.
It works using a client (iDevice)/server (Mac) model and facilitates extracting data from a live device.

You should implement your own data processors and parsers within the client Bash script.

Compared to ZPET, AL is much cleaner and presents less pre-requesites in terms of device state. It also presents better error handling abilities.

I have included a demonstration function to retrieve some basic device information and associated accounts on-device.
