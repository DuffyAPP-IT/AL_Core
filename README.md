# AL_Core
AL_Core provides the foundations for my commercial software AgentLIVE.
It works using a client (iDevice)/server (Mac) model.

You should implement your own data processors and parsers within the client Bash script.

Compared to ZPET, AL is much cleaner and presents less preequesites in terms of device state. It also presents better error handling abilities.
